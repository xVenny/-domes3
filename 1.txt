In an enlightened nation like our own there are followers of every science which has been marked out for human pursuit There is no study which has met with entire neglect from all classes of our countrymen There are men of all ranks and every shade of opinion who study the laws of Divine Providence and human duty There are many more who inquire how the universe was formed and under what rules its movements proceed Others look back to the records of society and study the history of their race Others examine and compare the languages of many nations Others study the principles on which civil laws are founded and try to discover what there has been of good as well as of evil in the governments under which men have lived from the time of the patriarchs till now Othersbut they are very fewinquire into the principles which regulate the production and distribution of the necessaries and comforts of life in society  It is a common and true observation that every man is apt to think his own principal pursuit the ivmost important in the world It is a persuasion which we all smile at in one another and justify in ourselves This is one of the least mischievous of human weaknesses since as nobody questions that some pursuits are really more important than others there will always be a majority of testimonies in favour of those which are so only subject to a reservation which acts equally upon all If for instance votes were taken as to the comparative value of the study of medicine the divine would say that nothing could be more important except theology the lawyer the same excepting law the mathematician the same excepting mathematics the chemist the same excepting chemistry and so on As long as every man can split his vote and all are agreed to give half to themselves the amount of the poll will be the same as if all gave whole votes There is encouragement therefore to canvass as we are about to do in favour of a candidate whom we would fain see more popular than at present  Can anything more nearly concern all the members of any society than the way in which the necessaries and comforts of life may be best procured and enjoyed by all Is there anything in any other study which does not involve this that can be compared with it in interest and importance And yet Political Economy has been less studied than perhaps any other science whatever and not at all by those whom it most concernsthe mass of the people This must be because its nature and its relation to vother studies are not understood It would not else be put away as dull abstract and disagreeable It would be too absurd to complain of its being difficult in an age when the difficulties of science appear to operate as they should do in stimulating to enterprise and improving patience  Political Economy treats of the Production Distribution and Consumption of Wealth by which term is meant whatever material objects contribute to the support and enjoyment of life Domestic economy is an interesting subject to those who view it as a whole who observe how by good management in every department all the members of a family have their proper business appointed them their portion of leisure secured to them their wants supplied their comforts promoted their pleasures cared for how harmony is preserved within doors by the absence of all causes of jealousy how good will prevail towards all abroad through the absence of all causes of quarrel It is interesting to observe by what regulations all are temperately fed with wholesome food instead of some being pampered abovestairs while others are starving below how all are clad as becomes their several stations instead of some being brilliant in jewels and purple and fine linen while others are shivering in nakedness how all have something be it much or little in their purses instead of some having more than they can use while others are tempted to snatch from them in the daytime or purloin by night Such extremes as these are seldom or never to be met viwith under the same roof in the present day when domestic economy is so much better understood than in the times when such sights were actually seen in rich mens castles but in that larger familythe nationevery one of these abuses still exists and many more If it has been interesting to watch and assist the improvement of domestic economy from the days of feudal chiefs till now can it be uninteresting to observe the corresponding changes of a state If it has been an important service to equalize the lot of the hundred members of a great mans family it must be incalculably more so to achieve the same benefit for the many millions of our population and for other nations through them This benefit cannot of course be achieved till the errors of our national management are traced to their source and the principles of a better economy are established It is the duty of the people to do this  If a stranger had entered the castle of a nobleman eight hundred years ago and grieved at what he saw had endeavoured to put matters on a better footing how ought he to set about it and in what temper should he be listened to If he had the opportunity of addressing the entire household at once he would say I have been in your splendid halls and I saw vast sums squandered in gaming while hungry creditors were looking on from without with rage in their countenances I have been in your banquetingroom and I saw riot and drunkenness today where there will be disease and remorse tomorrow viiI have been in your kitchens and I saw as much waste below as there had been excess above while the under servants were driven into a cold corner to eat the broken food which was not good enough for their masters dogs I have been in your dungeons and I saw prisoners who would fain have labored for themselves or their fellowcaptives condemned to converse in idleness with their own melancholy thoughts or with companions more criminal and miserable than themselves I have been among the abodes of those who hew your wood and draw your water and till your fields and weave your garments and I find that they are not allowed to exchange the produce of their labor as they will but that artificial prices are set upon it and that gifts are added to the profits of some which are taken out of the earnings of others I hear complaints from all in turn from the highest to the lowest complaints which I cannot call unreasonable since it is equally true that the poor among you are oppressed and that the rich are troubled that the rulers are perplexed and the governed discontented These things need not be There are methods of governing a family which will secure the good of all I invite you to join me in discovering what these methods are What would be thought of the good sense of such a household if they should reject the invitationif the rulers should say We are much perplexed it is true to know how to govern but it is very difficult to change the customs of a family and so we will go on viiias we are if the sons and daughters of the house should reply It is true the servants threaten us with vengeance and we have more trouble than enough with their complaints but we should find the inquiry you propose very dull and disagreeable so do not let us hear any more about it if the servants should say We have many grievances certainly and we can easily tell what ought to be remedied but as to what the remedies are we are told we cannot understand the subject so instead of trying to learn we shall redress our troubles in our own way If this is folly if this is neglect if this is madness it is no more than as many people are guilty of as refuse to hear anything of Political Economy because it is new or because it is dull or because it is difficult No one could make any of these objections if he knew the nature or saw anything of the utility and beauty of the science  Halfcivilized states were like the halfcivilized household we have described eight centuries ago We wish we could go on to say that civilized states are managed like civilized households that Political Economy was nearly as well understood by governments as domestic economy is by the heads of families That it is far otherwise our national distresses too plainly show The fault lies however quite as much with the governed as with their rulers Unless the people will take the pains to learn what it is that goes wrong and how it should be rectified they cannot petition intelligently or effectually and ixgovernment will regard their complaints as unreasonable and their afflictions as past help However true it may be that governments ought to look over the world at large for the purpose of profiting by universal experience and improving their measures in proportion as knowledge advances it is equally true that the people should look abroad also and observe and compare and reflect and take to heart whatever concerns the common interests of the millions of their countrymen If many of them occupy such a position as that they cannot do this is it not at least their duty should it not be their pleasure to listen to those who have observed and compared and reflected and come to a certain knowledge of a few grand principles which if generally understood would gradually remove all the obstructions and remedy the distresses and equalize the lot of the population Such ought to be the disposition of the people  But the people complain and justly that no assistance has been offered them which they could make use of They complain that all they can do is to pick up bits and scraps of knowledge of Political Economy because the works which profess to teach it have been written for the learned and can interest only the learned This is very true and it is the consequence of the science being new All new sciences are for some time engrossed by the learned both because preparation is required before they can be generally understood and because it is some time before men perceive how close an interest xthe bulk of society has in every new truth It is certain however that sciences are only valuable in as far as they involve the interests of mankind at large and that nothing can prevent their sooner or later influencing general happiness This is true with respect to the knowledge of the stars to that of the formation and changes of the structure of the globe to that of chemical elements and their combinations and above all to that of the social condition of men It is natural that the first eminent book on this new science should be very long in some parts exceedingly difficult and however wonderful and beautiful as a whole not so clear and precise in its arrangement as it might be This is the case with Smiths Wealth of Nationsa book whose excellence is marvelous when all the circumstances are considered but which is not fitted nor designed to teach the science to the great mass of the people It has discharged and is discharging its proper office in engaging the learned to pursue the study and in enabling them to place it in new lights according to the various needs of various learners It is natural again that the first followers of the science should differ among themselves and that some should think certain points important which others think trifling and it is a matter of course that their disputes must be tiresome to those who know little of the grounds of them It is perfectly natural that the science should be supposed obscure and the study of it fruitless which could thus cause contradictions and perplexities at the xivery outset It is perfectly natural that when certainty began to be obtained and regularity to come out of the confusion formality should be the order of the day that truths should be offered in a cold dry form and should be left bare of illustration and made as abstract and unattractive as possible This is a very hopeful state of things however for when truth is once laid hold of it is easy to discover and display its beauty and this the last and easiest process is what remains to be done for Political Economy When it is done nobody must again excuse himself from learning out of discontent at the way in which it is taught  The works already written on Political Economy almost all bear a reference to books which have preceded or consist in part of discussions of disputed points Such references and such discussions are very interesting to those whom they concern but offer a poor introduction to those to whom the subject is new There are a few a very few which teach the science systematically as far as it is yet understood These too are very valuable but they do not give us what we wantthe science in a familiar practical form They give us its history they give us its philosophy but we want its picture They give us truths and leave us to look about us and go hither and thither in search of illustrations of those truths Some who have a wide range in society and plenty of leisure find this allsufficient but there are many more who have neither time nor opportunity for such an application xiiof what they learn We cannot see why the truth and its application should not go togetherwhy an explanation of the principles which regulate society should not be made more clear and interesting at the same time by pictures of what those principles are actually doing in communities  For instance if we want to teach that security of property is necessary to the prosperity of a people and to shew how and in what proportion wealth increases where there is that security and dwindles away where there is not we may make the fact and the reasons very well understood by stating them in a dry plain way but the same thing will be quite as evident and far more interesting and better remembered if we confirm our doctrine by accounts of the hardships suffered by individuals and the injuries by society in such a country as Turkey which remains in a state of barbarism chiefly through the insecurity of property The story of a merchant in Turkey in contrast with one of a merchant in England will convey as much truth as any set of propositions on the subject and will impress the memory and engage the interest in a much greater degree This method of teaching Political Economy has never yet been tried except in the instance of a short story or separate passage here and there  This is the method in which we propose to convey the leading truths of Political Economy as soundly as systematically as clearly and faithfully as the utmost painstaking and the xiiistrongest attachment to the subject will enable us to do We trust we shall not be supposed to countenance the practice of making use of narrative as a trap to catch idle readers and make them learn something they are afraid of We detest the practice and feel ourselves insulted whenever a book of the trap kind is put into our hands It is many years since we grew sick of works that pretend to be stories and turn out to be catechisms of some kind of knowledge which we had much rather become acquainted with in its undisguised form The reason why we choose the form of narrative is that we really think it the best in which Political Economy can be taught as we should say of nearly every kind of moral science Once more we must apply the old proverb Example is better than precept We take this proverb as the motto of our design We declare frankly that our object is to teach Political Economy and that we have chosen this method not only because it is new not only because it is entertaining but because we think it the most faithful and the most complete There is no doubt that all that is true and important about any virtueintegrity for instancemay be said in the form of a lecture or written in a chapter of moral philosophy but the faithful history of an upright man his sayings and doings his trials his sorrows his triumphs and rewards teaches the same truths in a more effectual as well as more popular form In like manner the great principle of Freedom of Trade may be perfectly established by a very dry argument but xiva tale of the troubles and difficulties and changes of good and evil fortune in a manufacturer and his operatives or in the body of a manufacturing population will display the same principle and may be made very interesting besides to say nothing of getting rid of the excuse that these subjects cannot be understood  We do not dedicate our series to any particular class of society because we are sure that all classes bear an equal relation to the science and we much fear that it is as little familiar to the bulk of one as of another We should not be so ready to suspect this ignorance if we heard less of the difficulty of the subject We trust it will be found that as the leading principles come out in order one after another they are so clear so indisputable so apparently familiar that the wonder is when the difficulty is to comewhere the knotty points are to be encountered We suspect that these farfamed difficulties arise like the difficulties of mathematical and other sciences from not beginning at the beginning and going regularly on A student who should open Euclid in the middle could no more proceed from want of knowing what came before than a sawyer who should insert his saw in a hole in the middle of a plank could go on sawing while the wood was closed both behind and before In like manner any novice who wishes to learn in a hurry the philosophy of Wages and dips into a treatise for the purpose can make nothing of it for want of understanding the previous chapters on Labour and Capital This is the only way xvin which we can account for the common notion of the difficulty of the science and as this notion is very prevalent we are constrained to believe that the ignorance we speak of is prevalent too When therefore we dedicate our series to all to whom it may be of use we conceive that we are addressing many of every class  If we were to dedicate our work to all whom it may concern it would be the same thing as appealing to the total population of the empire We say this of course in reference to the subject and not to our peculiar method of treating it Is there any one breathing to whom it is of no concern whether the production of food and clothing and the million articles of human consumption goes on or ceases whether that production is proportioned to those who live whether all obtain a fair proportion whether the crimes of oppression and excess on the one hand and violence and theft on the other are encouraged or checked by the mode of distribution Is there any one living to whom it matters not whether the improvement of the temporal condition of the race shall go on or whether it shall relapse into barbarism whether the supports of life the comforts of home and the pleasures of society shall become more scanty or more abundant whether there shall be increased facilities for the attainment of intellectual good or whether the old times of slavery and hardship shall return Is any one indifferent whether famine stalks through the land laying low the xvihelpless and humbling the proud or whether by a wise policy the nations of the earth benefit one another and secure peace and abundance at home by an exchange of advantages abroad Is there any one living in short to whom it matters not whether the aggregate of human life is cheerful and virtuous or mournful and depraved The question comes to this for none will doubt whether a perpetuity of ease or hardship is the more favourable to virtue If it concerns rulers that their measures should be wise if it concerns the wealthy that their property should be secure the middling classes that their industry should be rewarded the poor that their hardships should be redressed it concerns all that Political Economy should be understood If it concerns all that the advantages of a social state should be preserved and improved it concerns them likewise that Political Economy should be understood by all  As society is in widely different states of advancement in various parts of the world we have resolved to introduce as wide a diversity of scenery and characters as it might suit our object to employ Each tale will therefore be usually if not always complete in itself as a tale while the principles it exhibits form a part of the system which the whole are designed to convey As an instance of what we mean the scene of the first tale is laid in a distant land because there is no such thing to be found in our own country as Labour uncombined with Capital and proceeding through many stages to a perfect xviiunion with Capital In the next volume which treats of the operation and increase of Capital the scene is laid in a more familiar region because Capital can be seen in full activity only in a highly civilized country  As the necessaries and comforts of life must be produced before they can be distributed and distributed before they can be consumed the order of subjects seems to be determined by their nature  We propose to show what Labour can effect and how it is to be encouraged and economized and rewarded to treat of Capital its nature and operation and the proportions of its increase and to exhibit the union of these two mighty agents of Production Under the second head Distribution occur the great questions of Rent Profits Wages and Population the various modes of Interchange at home and abroad including the consideration of all Monopolies domestic and foreign Under the third head Consumption are considered the modes of Demand and Supply and of Taxation All these and many more will be exemplified in sketches of society in narratives of those who labour and earn and spend who are happy or otherwise according as the institutions under which they live are good or bad There can be no lack of subjects for such tales in our own country where the pauper and the prince the beneficent landlord and the unreasonable tenant the dissolute grandee and the industrious artizan are to be found in the near neighbourhood of each xviiiother If we look farther abroad into lands where different institutions vary the interests of individuals we are furnished with rich illustrations of every truth our science can furnish If we could hope to supply the interest as abundantly as society does the subjectmatter of our tales we should reckon upon their success and usefulness as certain We will do our best  It is our design to affix to each volume a summary of the principles of Political Economy which it contains In this volume only we shall prefix it in order to lead the reader to a full understanding of the purpose of the work as he advances with it   There are few climates in the world more delightful to live in than that of the south of Africa The air of the mountains behind the Cape of Good Hope is pure and wholesome and the plains which stretch out towards the north at a great height above the sea are fertile in native plants when uncultivated and richly repay the toil of the farmer The woods are remarkable for the variety of trees and shrubs and there are as many animals which may serve for food or for beasts of burden as in this country These advantages would lead numbers of our countrymen to settle in southern Africa who now go elsewhere if it were not for one great drawback It is not that there are beasts of prey for lions leopards and panthers may be kept away from a settlement by the use of proper precautions it is that a race of men more fierce than wild beasts and full of cunning inhabit the mountains on the northern frontier of the European settlements 4and descend from time to time upon the lonely farms or small villages scattered over the plain and slaughter the inhabitants burn their dwellings and carry off their cattle and their goods It is nearly impossible to guard against the attacks of these savages and as a considerable force is required to resist them it is no wonder that settlers are disposed to sacrifice many advantages of climate soil and productions rather than be subject to the continual dread of a visit from the Bushmen as these people are called The settlements towards the northern frontier are therefore few and small and consist of those whose poverty induces them to brave danger and whose courage is improved by constant exercise  The Bushmen were the original possessors of much of the country about the Cape which the British and the Dutch have since taken for their own The natives were hunted down like so many wild beasts This usage naturally made them fierce and active in their revenge The hardships they have undergone have affected their bodily make also and their short stature and clumsy form are not as some suppose a sufficient proof that they are of an inferior race to the men they make war upon If we may judge by the experiments which have been tried upon the natives of various countries it seems probable that if Europeans were driven from their homes into the mountains and exposed to the hardships of a savage life they would become stunted in their forms barbarous in their habits and cruel in their revenge They might like the Bushmen 5visit the sins of the first invaders upon their innocent successors and cause as much undeserved distress as that we are about to relate  It was in the month of Septembera season of extreme heat in the climate we have describedwhen the inhabitants of a small British settlement in the north of the European territories of South Africa met to consider what should be done to relieve the want to which they were suddenly reduced The evening before their village looked thriving and its inhabitants gay and prosperous and now just when morning had dawned they assembled to look on the ruin of their habitations and the nakedness of their meadows from which all the cattle had been driven away The savages had carried off their tools and their arms burned their little furniture with the houses and left them nothing but the clothes they wore and the seed which was buried in the ground Happily but few lives were lost for the attack had been so sudden that little resistance had been attempted but yet some were gone whose services could ill be spared even if they had not attached their companions to them by having shared the same toils or by their several good qualities Williams the carpenter was found dead among the ashes in the sawpit and Humby had been slaughtered on the threshold of the new hut he was building on his little farm Some of the children too had perished in the flames but the loss of life was found to be much less than every one had supposed before the numbers were called over The most general and 6eager inquiries were for the safety of Captain Adams and of Mr and Mrs Stone and their child who were all alive and unhurt  Mr Stone was the besteducated man in the settlement and was therefore much valued as a chaplain and teacher as well as in his character of a practical farmer His wife was an amiable strongminded woman who assisted her husband in his labours abroad and at home She was by common consent called the Lady of the settlement but she refused the title not because she was not really a lady but because she thought there was no reason for such a distinction in a place where all were obliged to exert their own power for their own subsistence She had one child a girl of three years old  Mr Adams was called Captain only because he in a manner took the direction of the affairs of the settlement Having been long accustomed to the climate and acquainted with all the peculiarities of the country he was well qualified to advise respecting the proceedings of his neighbours who looked up to him as if he had really been what they called him and had a captains authority over them It was he who now assembled them under the shelter of a few trees which grew in a nook between two hills When they met they looked on one another and no one seemed disposed to speak The captain was about to break silence when the sobbing of one of the women who had lost her child and the wailing of the carpenters widow affected him so much that he could not command 7his voice Mr Stone who was remarkable for his selfcommand next came forward and said that the friends around him had been called together that they might determine what measures should be taken for their safety and subsistence and that it appeared to him that the right way to begin was by addressing God in a spirit of resignation for what they had lost and of thankfulness for what remained This was the readiest means of consoling the mourners who were among them and of so calming the minds of all as that they might deliberate soberly and judge wisely in an extremity so awful  To this there was a general assent and all heads were bowed and all sounds except the voice of Mr Stone hushed in prayer  When this was over and a pause had succeeded the captain observed that the first consideration of every man among them must be to secure food and shelterfood for the present day and shelter for perhaps one night only for the next question was whether they should remain in the settlement and build up its ruins as well as they could or set out southwards with the hope of finding a safer restingplace or aid from their countrymen In the first place then he must declare his hope that every individual would lay aside all selfish thoughts and come forward to say what provisions remained in his hands or upon his portion of ground  Mr Stone offered an antelope which had been snared the day before and fastened within an inclosure which the savages had not entered 8He feared that but little was left of his first crop of fruit and that the next would not be ripe for some weeks but said that whatever remained should be carried to any appointed spot Campbell the herdsman said he had not a beast left of all the flocks he had charge of but he would venture to follow on the track of the savages for a few miles and if a stray ox or sheep should be left behind it should be in the camp before nightfall Upon this two or three men offered to go out hunting if weapons were furnished and others proposed fishing if they had but tackle  This is all very well said the captain who suspected that neither weapons nor tackle were to be had but our object is to find out what food is actually in our possession  Alas this was soon made out There was only Mr Stones antelope a few oranges grapes and figs some eggs which were found near the roosts and some fowls which began to appear again after having been scared away by the fires This was all the provision that could be collected for fiftyfour persons  It is clear then said the captain that the greater number of us must disperse in search of food and that all considerations of removal must be deferred till tomorrow at least We are in no condition to travel this day But our nights shelter must also be thought of Let any one speak who has a plan to propose  Here again there was a pause for every one was wishing that poor Williams the carpenter 9was among them At length Robertson a farmer said  If we could find up tools enough we might have a sort of roof over our heads before night for I believe there are several here who have been used like myself to handle a hatchet though not as a regular business like poor Williams who is gone But if we cannot have tools I see nothing for it but to sleep under the open sky It is damp in the woods and besides the beasts would couch in our neighbourhood and the women and children would not sleep for their roaring even supposing we men could  The nights are frosty said Mr Stone it is dangerous to sleep unsheltered after such hot days Who has a hatchet to produce  Not one was forthcoming and each looked at his neighbour in dismay  A labourer then proposed that a party of two or three should explore the pass of the mountains to the east and see whether there were caves or any places in the rock which might be covered in with boughs and rushes so as to make a convenient sleepingplace  Excellent cried the captain And lest this plan should fail us let another company go into the wood and try whether we cannot get possession of some stout branches though we have no tools Some must have snapped in the wind last week I should think and so dry as the weather has been for many weeks some will yield to force if we put our strength into 10our hands We must remember that our hands are our tools today and we must ply them well  I do not see said Mr Stone why the weakest should be idle Cannot the children pluck dry grass and brushwood to make fires round our sleepingplace  My child shall do her part said Mrs Stone She shall look for eggs about the roost and some of the boys and I will gather the fruit and cook the antelope and whatever game may be brought in  And I said her husband will see that the bodies of those we have lost are buried without delay and with proper respect Let the mourners of their families follow me  When Mr Stone and about eight of the company had retired the captain proceeded to appoint to the others their various tasks His office of superintendent was enough for him His advice and help were wanted every moment for it was no easy matter to perform tasks all the materials for which were wanting  First of all Campbell the herdsman was sent with two of Robertsons labourers to follow the Bushmen and pick up any stray lamb or wearied beast which might have been left behind They looked round wistfully for a noose thinking that they might snare an antelope by the way but not a thread of cordage was left They were obliged to be content with a stout cudgel each which they took from the trees as they passed  11Jack the tanners man set off with two companions up the pass in search of a sleepingplace while his master who was accustomed to go into the woods to obtain bark for tanning guided a party of labourers to a tree of remarkably hard and tough wood which he had barked and stripped of its branches of which he thought tools of a rude kind might be made It occurred to him also that the want of ropes might be supplied by thongs of leather tanned and prepared according to the manner of the natives and he wished therefore to proceed upon the antelopes skin without delay So his object was to obtain hard wood to make a rude sort of tools and bark for tanning  Hill the barbersurgeon had explored the whole neighbourhood in search of herbs for his medical purposes and he told of a pool of remarkably fine water about two miles off which abounded with carp They had only to pass a net through the water he said and they would soon catch enough to feed their company This might be true but where was the net Hill could not furnish one but he could tell how one might be obtained within a short time He could shew where flax grew in abundance and if two or three clever pairs of hands would help him the fibres might be dried and pulled out and twisted and woven into a net and in three days they might have a plentiful meal of fish Hills wife and her sister Kate and the three children went with him about this business  If they had but left us our dogs said Arnall 12a great sportsman and one of the partners of the store or shop where all the commodities of the settlement were exchangedif they had but left us our dogs we might have started game in abundance  And much use it would be of to us replied his partner Mr Dunn when we have no guns to bring it down  I shot a partridge without a gun the other day said George Prest the butchers son Mr Arnall laughed at my bow and arrows then but perhaps he would like such an one now very well  If you will bring me such an one tomorrow my boy said Arnall you shall have the first bird I bring down  I am afraid your arrows are not strong enough to kill a hare said Dunn If you help me to a hare you shall have her skin to make a cap of for your bare head  If your dogs will run me down a porcupine said the boy you shall have your hare and her skin into the bargain A hedgehogs bristles are strong enough to wound a partridge but nothing less than a porcupine quill will reach larger game  So saying George ran off to beg a string of the gut of the antelope from Mrs Stone and to find a suitable slip of wood for a bow and some lighter pieces for arrows with tufts of the soft hair of the antelope which must serve instead of feathers till a bird could be brought down Meanwhile Arnall climbed a hill and whistled 13shrill and long for his dogs one of which at length made his appearance limping and wearied Jowler had however sport enough in him to turn out a hedgehog which was immediately killed stripped of its bristles and put away to be cooked the next day after the manner of the natives if better food should fall short  The rest of the labourers meanwhile were employed under the captains direction in various tasks Some assisted at the burial of their companions As they had not the means of digging graves for the dead and as it was necessary on account of the extreme heat not to defer the rite the bodies were deposited together in the sawpit which was afterwards filled up with sand and earth Others of the men built a sort of oven with stones one large flat one being placed at the bottom of a hole scooped out in the sand and others placed upright round the sides of the hole This was filled with burning wood till the stones were thoroughly heated then the ashes were swept out and the meat which had been skinned and cut up with fragments of granite put in and the whole closed with a hot stone and lastly fire was heaped above and round the whole  I wonder whether it will be good said one of the children who watched the whole proceeding There is no flour to sprinkle it with nor yet salt There will be very little gravy  And what there is will all run out between the stones into the sand said another And what shall we eat our dinner off We have no 14dishes or plates I never had my dinner without a plate  If you cannot eat without a plate said Mrs Stone suppose you try to find or make one instead of standing with your hands behind you If you and your brother go into that quarry which is just opened I should not wonder if you find a service of plates which will answer our purpose very well  There is nothing there but slates said the boy They are flat enough for plates to be sure but they have no rim and even Jowlers trencher had a rim  Being again reminded however that there was likely to be no gravy to run over little Harry set off in search of a dinner service He looked out a great many flat pieces of slate and rubbed them so clean with dry grass that no dust remained His brother meanwhile broke stones against the hard rock and picked out the sharpest bits to serve for knives  When they had done this Mrs Stone called them to help her to gather fruit and they climbed the trees in the orchard where a few oranges were still hanging among the dark leaves Some plums and apples also remained and a purple bunch of grapes here and there upon the trailing vines Little Betsy their sister had a quick ear and while she was picking up oranges she heard some way off in the wood the cry of a bird which she knew very well So she slipped away without being missed to try whether she could not add something acceptable to the dessert by the help of this bird The Honeycuckoo 15as Betsys friend is called lives on the honey which the wild bees store in the hollow trunks of trees It is sometimes called the Indicator because by uttering its peculiar cry whenever it meets with a stock of honey it points out the way to the honeytree Betsy had often followed this bird from tree to tree and when the bees were absent as wild bees usually are on a sunny day it was her custom to place a leaf on the ground with some honey on it for the bird and then to carry off a part of what remained Nothing had been easier hitherto than to obtain and bring away this honey which was as clear and liquid as water Betsy brushed it out of the hollows of the wood with a painters brush which she kept clean for the purpose and she let it run into the white basin out of which she ate her breakfast But now the brush was burned and the basin gone and when she had overtaken the bird in the wood she did not know what to do for want of her utensils and her guide fluttered onwards and did not like to be kept waiting She twisted a wisp of dry grass which did very well instead of her brush but after she had taken possession of a leaffull of honey and found that it ran over and escaped between her fingers she found she must devise a better plan or leave the honey behind She had nothing on that she could make into a basket or basinno hat no pocket nothing but her shoes and those she could not spare At last she bethought herself of marking the trees and returning for the honey when the bird should be gone so she picked up a piece of red earth and marked each 16honeytree with a cross When she had marked six and began to be tired she followed the bird no farther but sat down beside a pool of water where rushes grew in plenty and began to weave them into a sort of basket or basin She had been accustomed to make caps of rushes for her brothers in play and was expert She made just such an one now and lined it thick with the large leaves of the figtree and tied twigs crosswise over the top to keep it in shape By the time this was done she was rested and made her way back merrily through the wood delighted to find how abundant the honey was and how well her vessel held it On the way it occurred to her that it would not be pleasant to eat honey by dipping the fingers into it when other persons were doing the same and no better mode seemed to be left She wondered whether she could make a spoonbrush such as she had seen the natives prepare and use for taking up liquids The plant of which this sort of brush is made grows in great abundance in those parts and she had no difficulty in finding it Its stem is hard and fibrous and flat being about two inches broad and very thin Betsy cut the stem off in the middle with a sharp stone and then beat it till it was bruised so that she could separate the fibres with her fingers When it was done she dipped it into the honey and found that it took up quite sufficient for a mouthful She made six before she turned her face homewards As she took down her honeybasket from the bough on which she had hung it she was rather alarmed to see that the sun was getting low in 17the sky and pursued her way as fast as she could lest she should hear the roaring of wild beasts before she got out of the wood  Just when she was quitting the shade and going to cross the meadow she heard a rustling in the bushes close beside her She did not scream but her limbs bent under her for she expected to see a panther or perhaps a lion ready to spring upon her She looked behind her for the fiery eyes which she supposed were glaring amidst the underwood Her delight was great to see that it was the herdsmans dogan old acquaintance whose bark now sounded cheerily when she had listened only for a savage growl Campbell himself soon appeared with a lamb on his shoulder which he had overtaken feeding by itself upon the hills  Betsy wished him joy of his prize but he did not answer her and looked very melancholy  Has any new thing happened asked the little girl Are Will and Richard safe  Yes they are behind driving home a bullock and Will has got a hare that Keeper took by the ears for us  O what good luck cried Betsy But one would not have thought it by your looks What makes you look so gloomy  Why it seems ungrateful to say that it is this lamb said Campbell It is not that I do not like to have it back again but it makes me pine for the rest This morning when I went out I thought as was fit less about the poor beasts than about the folks we are going to seeing 18how little prospect of food there was before them But when I heard the bleat of this lamb and I saw it come skipping towards me I thought to myself Where are the rest And then it seemed hard to see the very traces of them in the track and to know what a little way they were before us and yet to turn back and leave them to be slaughtered by those savages I little thought when I called home the cows and penned the sheep last night that I should never see one of all of them again but this poor beast  Little Betsy did not know what to say and so she plucked a handful of grass for the lamb  In a few minutes they reached the place where dinner was going forward Though it was the first meal that day many of the people had eaten sparingly not knowing whether anything might be provided for the next day When they saw the lamb however and heard of the bullock they helped themselves again They did not relish their hardearned meal the less for the clumsy manner in which they were obliged to eat it  Campbell would not join them till he had disposed of his charge The fences were so injured that it was necessary to pile up all the wood that could be laid hold of to stop the gaps This done the herdsman cast a mournful glance at these poor remains of his droves and flocks and sat down to refresh himself  Mrs Stone and Betsys mother Mrs Links the smiths wife had grown uneasy about the little girl on account of her long absence but 19they could not blame her when they saw what she had been doing They bade her carry the honey and brushes to the captain who acted as storekeeper and receivergeneral of whatever was brought in He patted her on the head and said she had done her part and he moreover gave her his share of fruit without which she would have had none for there was not enough for everybody The captain said that the honey should be for those who came too late for the fruit that all might have some kind of vegetable nourishment And as for the spoonbrushes they were so useful that everybody must have one So little Betsy determined to make plenty more the next day and was quite happy  And now said the captain it is high time we were setting off to our sleepingplace Jack kindle your torch and go first and Hill and Robertson will follow with lights The rest of you must take care of your own families and see that none are left behind but the few who have not returned from the woods I will just stay to light the fire we have piled for them and then follow you If they do not come by the time that woodheap is burnt we shall not see them tonight So saying the brave captain took his stand and hurried the people away first lighting his torch and promising to follow soon All the way as they went Mr Stone looked back in hopes of seeing his friend advancing but it was not till they had been settled at their sleepingplace 20nearly an hour that they saw the glimmering light of his torch coming slowly up the pass between the rocks  The sleepingplace was such an one as the whole party were very thankful to have found though its distance two miles from the settlement was likely to add considerably to their daily toils It consisted of two caverns one within the other sufficiently dry and open to the air to be wholesome but not lofty enough to admit of a fire being kindled within or even of a torch being burned there for any length of time The inner cave which was set apart for the women and children had been swept out with bundles of rushes and the floor thickstrewn with dry grass by the men who had explored it in the morning Mr Stone entered it first this night in order to satisfy himself that there was no other passage to it than from the larger cave and when he came out he delivered the torch to his wife desiring her to give it into no hand less careful than her own while her companions were laying themselves down to rest and to return it to him before she should herself retire for if a single spark should fall on the dry grass they would inevitably be driven from their shelter  What a beautiful room cried some of the little children as they opened their sleepy eyes and saw how the sides and roof glittering with crystals sparkled in the torchlight  If they do but keep up the fire on the outside said one of the mothers we may sleep as safely and warmly as in our own houses  21Perhaps she would not have said this if she had known what Jack could have told but wisely kept to himself that he had found in that very cave traces of a lion which had perhaps couched there the night before Jack properly considered that this was not a sufficient objection to the place as there were few spots in the neighbourhood where lions had not couched some time or other and as a good fire at the entrance of the cave was always a perfect security against the attack of wild beasts Lest others should not think so however he held his peace towards everybody but the captain taking care that brushwood enough was stored to keep up a large fire till sunrise  When the captain had joined his people Mr Stone offered to conduct their devotions as he had done this morning Standing at the entrance between the two caverns so that he could be heard by those within and those without he offered thanksgiving for their preservation during so eventful and perilous a day and besought protection during the night  He and the captain then took their station as watchers just within the outer cave having promised that Robertson and Arnall should be called up to take their place when half the night had passed  Well my friend said the captain to Mr Stone as they sat watching their fire how do you feel at the close of this strange day  Very much as if I were in a dream When I look round this place and think of all that I have seen and done since morning I can scarcely believe that we are the same people living in the same age of the world as yesterday We seem to have gone back in the course of a night from a state of advanced civilization to a primitive condition of society  Except interrupted his friend that the intelligence belonging to a state of advancement remains  True replied Mr Stone and it is this which makes the present too good an opportunity to be lost of observing what the real wealth of society consists of and what the unassisted labour of man can do towards producing that wealth  I wish said the captain that the people in England who think that wealth consists in gold and silver and bank notes would come here and see how much their money is worth in our settlement A thousand sovereigns would not here buy a hat nor a roll of bank notes a loaf of bread Here at least money is not wealth 23Nor any where else said Mr Stone as we may see by putting a very simple case Put a man with a bag of gold into an empty house in England or anywhere else and he will starve in a week unless he is allowed to give his gold in exchange for what will supply his wants But give a man who has not a shilling a room well stocked with meat and bread and beer and he has wealth enough to maintain him for a week or a fortnight or as long as his provision lasts And this is a test which holds good all the world over  And yet gold and silver may be called riches said the captain while they procure us things of greater value than themselves  Certainly they are as long as they can be made use of a part of wealth though only one and that not the greatest part Wealth is made up of many thingsof land of houses of clothes furniture food and of the means whether gold and silver or anything else by which these things may be obtained Whatever lives or grows or can be produced that is necessary or useful or agreeable to mankind is wealth  Then our settlement said the captain is not stripped of all its property We have some wealth left  Poor as we are said his friend we are richer than if we were in the midst of the sandy desert to the north of us with a waggon full of gold in our possession We have here what gold could not buy in such a place food and shelter  And other things too said the captain 24We have clothing for flax grows in the woods and there are plenty of animals within reach whose skins can be dried and cleaned to make us cloaks or beds or tanned for shoes and caps and aprons for our workmen We have furniture for there is plenty of timber in the woods to make tables and chairs We have  Stay interrupted his friend you are getting on too fast All these things are likely to become ours I grant you but before we can call them our ownbefore they become wealth to us something must be added which we have not yet taken into consideration You forget that there is no wealth without labour and labour must be applied before the commonest productions can become wealth  True replied the captain The flax must be gathered and dried and hackled and woven before it will make a shirt and the animals must be caught and a great deal of labour be spent upon their skins before they become fit for clothing or bedding and the timber must be felled and sawn and the pieces put skilfully together before we possess it in the form of tables and chairs But surely the case is different with food of some kinds at least There is fish in the pond and fruit on the tree ready made for mans use Man spends no labour on the fruit that grows wild in such a climate as this and yet we daily find that it is wealth to us  I beg your pardon said Mr Stone There is the labour of gathering it An orange is of no 25use to any man living unless he puts out his hand to pluck it And as for the fish in the pondthink of the carp that Hill told us of this morning They are no wealth to us till we can catch them though the pool is within reach and they belong to nobody else  We should have had them by this time if we had but got a net said the captain  The net is one thing wanting certainly said his friend but labour is another If the net were now lying ready on the bank we should be no better for the fish unless some one took the trouble of drawing them out of the water I do not say that unassisted labour will furnish us with all that we want but I do say that nothing can be had without the exertion of getting it that is that there is no wealth without labour  True said the captain Even the manna in the wilderness would have been of no more use to the Hebrews than the carp in the pool to us if they had not exerted themselves to gather it up Food was never yet rained into the mouth of any man  And if it had been said Mr Stone he must have troubled himself to hold back his head and open his mouth So you see what conclusion we come to even in an extreme case  But with all our labour said the captain how little we can do in comparison with what is done for us Labour may be necessary to make the productions of Nature useful to us but how much greater are the powers of Nature 26in preparing them for us To look back on farther than todaythe antelope could not have been food for us unless human hands had prepared it but how much was done beforehand It was nourished we know not how by the grass it fed upon it was made we know not how fit food for our bodies and our bodies were so formed as to be strengthened by this food Neither do we understand how fire acts upon the flesh so as to make it tender or even how wood in its turn nourishes the fire All that human labour has done was to bring together the wood and the fire and the animal and then to eat the food prepared Nature did the rest  The case was the same with little Betsys treat of honey added Mr Stone The earth and the air and the dew had nourished the flowers from which the honey was collected the bees were curiously formed and animated so that they could gather and store the honey and the hollows of the tree so made as to hold it Then again the rushes and the twigs and the leaves were all fit for the use Betsy made of them her business was to bring them together in a particular manner so as to make a basket And thus it is in every case And even where we seem to make the materials we only bring together simple materials to make compound ones We say that the materials of a rush basket are not made by human labour but that the materials of a paper basket are made by human labour but though paper is made of linenrags 27those rags are made of flax which grows out of the ground So that Nature still works at the bottom  In the same way said the captain we say that the material of a hareskin waistcoat is not produced by human labour but that the velvet one of a gentleman of fashion is altogether made by human hands but still Nature works at the bottom as you say for velvet is woven of silk spun by a worm  True said Mr Stone and thus far only is the labour of man appointed to go He works with Nature and his only way of doing so is by motion He moves her materials together but how they act upon one another he does not know You put your torch of wood into the flame and it blazes Robertson lets the seed fall into the ground and it sprouts he pulls up a root and it withers Hill applies certain herbs to a wound or gives certain medicines and his patients are cured or if they die he does not know how to prevent it Fulton dips and rubs his leather in a certain preparation of bark and it becomes soft and fit for use His mother puts flour and salt and barm together and the dough works she places it in a great heat and it becomes fit for food So man brings materials together but Nature first furnishes them and then makes them act upon one another  It seems but little that man can do said the captain but yet that little is allimportant to him  Since it is necessary to him said Mr 28Stone it becomes great and indeed it may be said that there are no bounds to what man can do since there seem to be no bounds to the powers of Nature Look what has been done There may have been I doubt not there was a time when the founders of nations could do nothing more than gather the wild fruits of the earth and find shelter in caves and now the successors of these very men produce merchandize and build ships and rear splendid buildings and make roads over mountains and do a thousand things which would have appeared miracles to their forefathers and all this time the wisest men are aware that labour may be employed in a multitude of ways of which we yet know nothing  I should like our people to remain in this settlement said the captain that we might observe how fast they will advance from the primitive state to which we are reduced to that in which their countrymen are in England  They will advance rapidly replied Mr Stone because they know how to apply their labour They know what improvements they would aim at instead of having to try experiments I hope we shall all stay for I am curious to see how much may be done by pure labour and pure labour is our only resource till we can get tools from Cape Town  It will take a long time to do that said the captain but I am not uneasy The Bushmen know well enough that nothing more is to be had from us and we are therefore safe from another attack till we shall have gathered some 29property about us again Do you know my dear friend nothing has given me so much satisfaction today as seeing your wife and yourself in such good spirits None of our people had so much to lose in the way of property as yourselvesfor I being a single man do not care much about those matters You neither of you seem to be downcast about your losses  Nor are we replied Mr Stone but you must remember how different it is to lose everything in such a place as this and in England Here there are so few inhabitants and the natural productions are in such plenty that we know we have only to work under the blessing of Providence to provide ourselves and our child with all that is necessary now and with comforts and luxuries by and by Besides there is here no loss of rank or sacrifice of independence because all are in the same condition It could not happen so in England and if any calamity should there oblige us to descend to a lower rank in society or worse still to be dependent for our subsistence upon others we should try I hope to be patient but we could not be so happy as you have seen us today  You have both good health and industry and contentment said the captain and they are exactly the qualities we all have most need of just now  Thank God we have always had cause for content replied his friend and as for industry the only difference is that we must now work in another way We have always declared 30that none deserved to be maintained who would not labour Before we worked most with our heads now we must work with our hands as well And we are both willing  And in order to be fit for labour said the captain you must sleep so let us pile some more wood on the fire and then rouse our watchmen  So when they had arranged the time and place for a general consultation on the affairs of the settlement the next morning the gentlemen gave up their charge to Robertson and Arnall and betook themselves to rest
